                <h2 style="color:#000; font-weight: bold">Part 01: Buyer searches for commodity</h2>
                <p>
                    The Buyer views commodity listings posted by producers by searching on the Ant Commodity website. Buyers can contact Ant Commodity Field Officers
                    for support via <a href="mailto:FindCorrectCommodity@AntCommodity.com">FindCorrectCommodity@AntCommodity.com</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Buyer can learn more about the producer by visiting the producer’s profile page.
                    On the profile page, the buyer has access to the producer’s inspection report,
                    pictures and other information about the producer’s business operations gathered by Ant Commodity

                <h2 style="color: #000; font-weight: bold">Buyer requests more information, samples, testing etc</h2>
                <p>
                    The Buyer sends a message to the producer to get clarification on the listed commodity or ask for
                    samples and testing. Depending on the request, the buyer may be asked to send a payment
                    to cover the cost of the activity. Ant Commodity will carry out the sampling
                    and testing work independently.
                    <br><br>
                    All requests and messages sent by the buyer are first reviewed by a field officer at
                    Ant Commodity. Ant Commodity field officer communicates with the producer and reply to the
                    Buyer accordingly. The typical reply time is around 4-5 hours, but can vary during
                    non-working hours and holidays.

                <h2 style="color: #000; font-weight: bold">Part 03: Buyer sends offer, and starts negotiating</h2>
                <p>
                    The Buyer starts the negotiation with the producer by sending a first offer. To submit
                    an offer successfully, the buyer must submit an offer price in FOB – USD
                    currency, the quantity Buyer wants to purchase, port of delivery,
                    incoterms and medium. If the Buyer has additional requests like lab testing, a specific
                    packing method, insurance etc., they should mention that in the Notes section.

                    <br><br>
                    Ant Commodity receives the offer and communicates with the Producer. After
                    consulting with the Producer, Ant Commodity replies to the Buyer with a formal acceptance or
                    counteroffer. Ant Commodity does not provide any advice or influence the decision-making process to
                    the Producer or Buyer.

                <h2 style="color: #000; font-weight: bold">Part 04: Buyer sends payment to Ant Commodity</h2>
                <p>
                    After the Buyer and Producer agree on a price, Ant Commodity creates a
                    contract based on the agreed-upon terms and sends payment instructions to the Buyer. The Buyer
                    is required to send the payment during the time frame specified in the contract.
                    <br><br>
                    Ant Commodity does not distribute money to the Producer until Ant Commodity inspects the
                    shipment and arranges delivery to the Buyer.

                <p>
                    Ant Commodity inspects the shipment to see whether the shipment has been prepared according to
                    the agreed-upon terms. If the Buyer has requested additional testing, Ant Commodity will
                    perform it at this stage. After receiving the inspector’s approval, Ant Commodity
                    will release the payment to the Producer after deducting Ant Commodity ’s
                    commission and other expenses.

                    <br><br>
                    Any discrepancies in the shipment will be communicated to the Buyer and Producer.
